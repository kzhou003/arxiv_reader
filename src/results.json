[{"title": "HyperAgent: Generalist Software Engineering Agents to Solve Coding Tasks at Scale", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized software engineering (SE), demonstrating remarkable capabilities in various coding tasks. While recent efforts have produced autonomous software agents based on LLMs for end-to-end development tasks, these systems are typically designed for specific SE tasks. We introduce HyperAgent, a novel generalist multi-agent system designed to address a wide spectrum of SE tasks across different programming languages by mimicking human developers' workflows. Comprising four specialized agents - Planner, Navigator, Code Editor, and Executor. HyperAgent manages the full lifecycle of SE tasks, from initial conception to final verification. Through extensive evaluations, HyperAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse SE tasks: it attains a 25.01% success rate on SWE-Bench-Lite and 31.40% on SWE-Bench-Verified for GitHub issue resolution, surpassing existing methods. Furthermore, HyperAgent demonstrates SOTA performance in repository-level code generation (RepoExec), and in fault localization and program repair (Defects4J), often outperforming specialized systems. This work represents a significant advancement towards versatile, autonomous agents capable of handling complex, multi-step SE tasks across various domains and languages, potentially transforming AI-assisted software development practices.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16299", "authors": "Huy Nhat Phan, Phong X.

Exploring efficient and eco-friendly solutions for NWP attracts interest from Artificial Intelligence (AI) and earth science communities. To narrow the performance gap between the AI-based methods and physic predictor, this work proposes a new transformer-based NWP framework, termed as WeatherFormer, to model the complex spatio-temporal atmosphere dynamics and empowering the capability of data-driven NWP. WeatherFormer innovatively introduces the space-time factorized transformer blocks to decrease the parameters and memory consumption, in which Position-aware Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator (PAFNO) is proposed for location sensible token mixing. Besides, two data augmentation strategies are utilized to boost the performance and decrease training consumption. Extensive experiments on WeatherBench dataset show WeatherFormer achieves superior performance over existing deep learning methods and further approaches the most advanced physical model.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16321", "authors": "Junchao Gong, Tao Han, Kang Chen, Lei Bai", "subjects": "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16321", "relevancy_score": 8, "reasons_for_match": "This paper is relevant to my research interests as it explores the application of artificial intelligence in numerical weather prediction, which is a key area of interest in computer science and artificial intelligence.

Alternative setups, such as Mixed-Initiative Co-Creative (MI-CC) systems, exhibited their promise. Still, the potential of an active mixed initiative, where AI takes a role beyond following, is understudied. This work investigates the influence of the adaptive ability of an active and learning AI agent on creators' expectancy of creative responsibilities in an MI-CC setting. We built and studied a system that employs reinforcement learning (RL) methods to learn the creative responsibility preferences of a human user during online interactions. Situated in story co-creation, we develop a Multi-armed-bandit agent that learns from the human creator, updates its collaborative decision-making belief, and switches between its capabilities during an MI-CC experience. With 39 participants joining a human subject study, Our developed system's learning capabilities are well recognized compared to the non-learning ablation, corresponding to a significant increase in overall satisfaction with the MI-CC experience. These findings indicate a robust association between effective MI-CC collaborative interactions, particularly the implementation of proactive AI initiatives, and deepened understanding among all participants.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16291", "authors": "Zhiyu Lin, Upol Ehsan, Rohan Agarwal, Samihan Dani, Vidushi Vashishth, Mark Riedl", "subjects": "Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16291", "relevancy_score": 6, "reasons_for_match": "This paper explores the concept of Mixed-Initiative Co-Creative systems in the context of story co-creation, which involves AI and human collaboration, but it's not directly related to general infrastructure in AI."}, {"title": "Explaining Human Comparisons using Alignment-Importance Heatmaps", "abstract": "We present a computational explainability approach for human comparison tasks, using Alignment Importance Score (AIS) heatmaps derived from deep-vision models. The AIS reflects a feature-map's unique contribution to the alignment between Deep Neural Network's (DNN) representational geometry and that of humans. We first validate the AIS by showing that prediction of out-of-sample human similarity judgments is improved when constructing representations using only higher-scoring AIS feature maps identified from a training set. We then compute image-specific heatmaps that visually indicate the areas that correspond to feature-maps with higher AIS scores. These maps provide an intuitive explanation of which image areas are more important when it is compared to other images in a cohort. We observe a correspondence between these heatmaps and saliency maps produced by a gaze-prediction model. However, in some cases, meaningful differences emerge, as the dimensions relevant for comparison are not necessarily the most visually salient. To conclude, Alignment Importance improves prediction of human similarity judgments from DNN embeddings, and provides interpretable insights into the relevant information in image space.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16292", "authors": "Nhut Truong, Dario Pesenti, Uri Hasson", "subjects": "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16292", "relevancy_score": 5, "reasons_for_match": "This paper presents a computational explainability approach for human comparison tasks using deep-vision models, but it's not directly related to general infrastructure in AI."}, {"title": "DeepScore: A Comprehensive Approach to Measuring Quality in AI-Generated Clinical Documentation", "abstract": "Medical practitioners are rapidly adopting generative AI solutions for clinical documentation, leading to significant time savings and reduced stress.
