[{"title": "The Star Clusters As Links between galaxy Evolution and Star formation (SCALES) project I: Numerical method", "abstract": "Stellar clusters are critical constituents within galaxies: they are the result of highest-density star formation, and through their spatially and temporally correlated feedback they regulate their host galaxy evolution. We present a novel numerical method to model star clusters as individual units of star formation using sink particles. In our method, star clusters grow via gas accretion and via merging with less massive clusters. We describe the implementation in the radiation hydrodynamics code GIZMO and run a large grid of marginally bound, turbulent clouds of $10^7~{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ to explore the effect of modeling ingredients on the evolution of the clouds and the star clusters. We find both gas accretion and mergers to be critical processes to form star clusters of masses up to $\\sim10^5$-$10^6~{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$, while ionising radiation is the main feedback mechanism regulating the growth of star clusters. The majority of our star clusters assemble their mass in $0.3$-$2.6~{\\rm Myr}$, and the most massive ones take $\\sim10~{\\rm Myr}$. By removing high density gas by accretion, our sink-based cluster formation prescription allows the newly-formed star clusters to inject their stellar feedback in less dense environments. This makes feedback more efficient at ionising and disrupting the cloud than if we were to use a standard star formation approach, indicating that our numerical method is the missing critical step to model the interplay between star clusters and their host galaxies.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04694", "authors": "Marta Reina-Campos, Oleg Y.

Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon as a Possible Sink for the Missing Sulfur in the Interstellar Medium. I. The C--S Band Strengths", "abstract": "Despite its biogeneic and astrochemical importance, sulfur (S), the 10th most abundant element in the interstellar medium (ISM) with a total abundance of S/H~2.2E-5, largely remains undetected in molecular clouds. Even in the diffuse ISM where S was previously often believed to be fully in the gas phase, in recent years observational evidence has suggested that S may also be appreciably depleted from the gas. What might be the dominant S reservoir in the ISM remains unknown. Solid sulfides like MgS, FeS and SiS_2 are excluded as a major S reservoir due to the undetection of their expected infrared spectral bands in the ISM. In this work, we explore the potential role of sulfurated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules -- PAHs with sulfur heterocycles (PASHs) -- as a sink for the missing S. Utilizing density function theory, we compute the vibrational spectra of 18 representative PASH molecules. It is found that these molecules exhibit a prominent, C--S stretching band at ~10 micron and two relatively weak, C--S deformation bands at 15 and 25 micron that are not mixed with the nominal PAH bands at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3 and 12.7 micron If several parts per million of S (relative to H) are locked up in PAHs, the 10 micron C--S band would be detectable by Spitzer and JWST. To quantitatively explore the amount of S/H depleted in PASHs, detailed comparison of the infrared emission spectra of PASHs with the Spitzer and JWST observations is needed.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04857", "authors": "X.J.

Here we present the first JWST NIRSpec IFS observations of SDSS J120122.30+021108.3, a nearby ($z=0.00354$) extremely metal poor dwarf galaxy with no optical signatures of accretion activity but identified by WISE to have extremely red mid-infrared colors consistent with AGNs. We identify over one hundred lines between $\\sim$ 1.7-5.2 microns, an unresolved nuclear continuum source with an extremely steep spectral slope consistent with hot dust from an AGN ($F_\\nu \\approx\\nu^{-1.5}$), and a plethora of H I, He I, and H$_2$ lines, with no lines from heavier elements, CO or ice absorption features, or PAHs.Our observations reveal that the red WISE source arises exclusively from a bright central unresolved source ($<$ 3pc) suggestive of an AGN, yet there are no He II lines or coronal lines identified in the spectrum, and, importantly, there is no evidence that the radiation field is harder in the nuclear source compared with surrounding regions. These observations can be explained with a young ($<$ 5 Myr) nuclear star cluster with stellar mass $\\sim3\\times 10^4$ M$_\\odot$ and a deeply embedded AGN with bolometric luminosity $\\sim$ $2\\times10^{41}$ ergs $^{-1}$.

We find that the linear quasi-adiabatic relaxation with additional dependence on the halo-centric distance provides a good description not only at $z=0$, but also at an earlier epoch ($z=1$) in the IllustrisTNG simulation suite, with parameters being more universal across a much larger variety of haloes at $z=1$ than at $z=0$. Through systematic analysis of a large collection of simulations from the CAMELS project, we find that the baryonic prescriptions for both AGN and stellar feedbacks have a strong influence on the relaxation response of the dark matter halo. In particular, only the parameters controlling the overall feedback energy flux have an effect on the relaxation response, while the wind speed and burstiness have negligible effect on the relaxation at a fixed amount of energy flux. However, the exact role of these parameters on the relaxation depends on the redshift. We also study the role of a variety of baryonic astrophysical processes through the EAGLE physics variation simulations. While these depict a similar picture regarding the importance of feedback effects, they also reveal that the gas equation of state has one of the strongest influences on the relaxation response, consistent with the expectation from self-similar analyses.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04864", "authors": "Premvijay Velmani, Aseem Paranjape", "subjects": "Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04864", "relevancy_score": 7, "reasons_for_match": "This paper investigates the role of astrophysical modeling in the relaxation response of dark matter haloes, providing insights into the impact of baryonic processes on the structure and evolution of galaxies, which is relevant to understanding the formation and dynamics of astrophysical systems."}, {"title": "The SDSS-V Black Hole Mapper Reverberation Mapping Project: Multi-Line Dynamical Modeling of a Highly Variable Active Galactic Nucleus with Decade-long Light Curves", "abstract": "We present dynamical modeling of the broad-line region (BLR) for the highly variable AGN SDSS J141041.25+531849.0 ($z = 0.359$) using photometric and spectroscopic monitoring data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping project and the SDSS-V Black Hole Mapper program, spanning from early 2013 to early 2023. We model the geometry and kinematics of the BLR in the H$\\beta$, H$\\alpha$, and MgII, emission lines for three different time periods to measure the potential change of structure within the BLR across time and line species. We consistently find a moderately edge-on $(i_{\\rm full-state} = 53.29^{\\circ} \\,{}^{+7.29}_{-6.55})$ thick-disk $(\\theta_{\\rm opn, \\; full-state} = 54.86^{\\circ} \\,{}^{+5.83}_{-4.74})$ geometry for all BLRs, with a joint estimate for the mass of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) for each of three time periods, yielding $\\log_{10}(M_{\\rm BH} / M_{\\odot}) = 7.66^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$ when using the full dataset. The inferred individual virial factor $f$ $\\sim 1$ is significantly smaller than the average factor for a local sample of dynamically modeled AGNs. There is strong evidence for non-virial motion, with over $80\\%$ of clouds on inflowing/outflowing orbits. We analyze the change in model parameters across emission lines, finding the radii of BLRs for the emission lines are consistent with the following relative sizes $R_{\\rm H\\beta} \\lesssim R_{\\rm MgII } \\lesssim R_{\\rm H\\alpha}$. Comparing results across time, we find $R_{\\rm low-state} \\lesssim R_{\\rm high-state}$, with the change in BLR size for H$\\beta$, being more significant than for the other two lines.

Such homogeneity suggests the dark and stellar components must somehow compensate for each other in order to produce such regular mass structures. We test the conspiracy using a sample of 22 galaxies from the `Middle Ages Galaxy Properties with Integral field spectroscopy' (MAGPI) Survey that targets massive galaxies at $ z \\sim 0.3$. We use resolved, 2D stellar kinematics with the Schwarzschild orbit-based modelling technique to recover intrinsic mass structures, shapes, and dark matter fractions. This work is the first implementation of the Schwarzschild modelling method on a sample of galaxies at a cosmologically significant redshift. We find that the variability of structure for combined mass (baryonic and dark) density profiles is greater than that of the stellar components alone. Furthermore, we find no significant correlation between enclosed dark matter fractions at the half-light radius and the stellar mass density structure. Rather, the total density profile slope, $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, strongly correlates with the dark matter fraction within the half-light radius, as $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{tot}} = (1.3 \\pm 0.2) f_{\\mathrm{DM}} - (2.44 \\pm 0.04)$.
